        //! \details Start test uses the private member variables, pointers of std::vector<double> type, which are set to point to the correct vectors in SummaryComparison::chooseReference(...). \n The function iterates over the referenceVev/basis and for each iteration it calculates the deviation with SummaryComparison::getDeviation(..) and stors it in a Deviation struct. \n SummaryComparison::getDeviation takes the int jvar as an reference input, and using it as an iterative index for the values which are to be compared with the basis. \n Thus, by updating the jvar variable every time a deviation is calculated, one keep track jvar and do not have to iterate over already checked values.

        //! \param[in] checkIndex The report step of which the deviation originates from in #checkDataVec.
        //! \details The function checks the values of the Deviation struct against the absolute and relative tolerance, which are private member values of the super class. \n When comparing against the relative tolerance an additional term is added, the absolute deviation has to be greater than 1e-6 for the function to throw an exception. \n When the deviations are too great, the function writes out which keyword, and at what report step the deviation is too great before throwing an exception.
